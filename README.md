# TicTacWTF

A ridiculously overthought Tic Tac Toe game, built just to flex some new skills and have a good laugh along the way. Minimalistic, fast, sarcastic — just like life should be.

## 💡 What is this?

TicTacWTF is a simple (but slightly chaotic) Tic Tac Toe game featuring:
- Randomly generated funny victory and draw messages.
- Built with clean, scalable React + TypeScript.
- Styled for maximum minimalism.
- Absolutely no prizes for winning.

Perfect for practicing, procrastinating, or confusing your friends.
